# Anamoly-Detection
BTech Thesis project on Anamoly Detection, 

##Algorithms Used

1. Isolation Forest.
2. Local Outlier 
3. SVM
4. Random Forest
5. XgBoost
6. Logistic Regression
7. BinomialNB and ComplementNB
8. Neural Networks ( Cost Sensitive Neural Networks )

## To handle Imbalanced datasets we used
1. Undersampling
2. Oversampling
3. SMOTE
4. Weighted Neural Networks
5. ComplementNB : especially used for highly imbalanced datasets

## Other Features
1. Dimensionality Reduction to reduce noise and improve complexity of the model
  a. Used normal t-SNE and AutoEncoders.
